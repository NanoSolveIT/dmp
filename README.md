# NanoSolveIT Data Management Plan Guidance

Status: this version is not released, very initial outline. It is not the final DMP, but meant as guidance for the full project, not merely the official initial release.

The actual DMP has been released as Deliverable Report 8.2.

This repository contains a Markdown version of the [NanoSolveIT Data Management Plan Guidance](DMP.md). The authors are listed in the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) file
and the license is given in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file. The CC-BY license allows reuse but requires attribution. All authors and projects must
be acknowledged in derived versions. That must include acknowleding the European Union funding all contributing projects received in the past.

## Customizing the plan

A more project-independent version of this plan can be found in the [DMP.i.md](DMP.i.md) file. This version uses annotation and command line
tools to customize the plan, making reuse easier. The source can be compiled by either of the following two commands (it needs
`make` (only for the first) and `groovy` installed):

```shell
make
```

Or:

```shell
groovy createMarkdown.groovy DMP.i.md NanoSolveIT 814572 > DMP.md
```
